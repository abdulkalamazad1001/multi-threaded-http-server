      <h1>About This HTTP Server</h1>
      <p>
        This project is a multi-threaded HTTP server developed in Python using
        low-level socket programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is designed to handle multiple clients concurrently by using a thread
        pool, improving efficiency and performance under load.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Concurrent Connections:</strong> Supports multiple client
          connections simultaneously with thread pool management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Static File Serving:</strong> Serves HTML, JPEG images, and
          text files with correct HTTP headers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JSON POST Uploads:</strong> Accepts JSON data uploads and
          securely saves them to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security:</strong> Implements path traversal protection and
          strict host header validation to prevent unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connection Management:</strong> Supports persistent HTTP
          connections with keep-alive and connection timeouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Provides appropriate HTTP error
          responses for malformed requests and unsupported operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comprehensive Logging:</strong> Logs all significant events
          including server activity, errors, and client interactions with
          timestamps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Python 3 with built-in socket and threading libraries.</li>
        <li>Standard HTTP/1.1 protocol handling and compliance.</li>
        <li>
          Basic file system operations for serving and saving files securely.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This server is primarily intended for educational purposes to illustrate
        core network programming and HTTP concepts.
